Solution:
- The binary function to process input with a dialog box (hDlg) -> 
- Main Function is DialogFunc

Input Capture:
char String[100];
GetDlgItemTextA(hDlg, 1000, String, 90);
-> retrieves text from dialog item with ID 1000
-> stores up to 90 characters in String

Validation logic:
-> XOR each input character with 0x65
-> Compare XORed character with corresponding byte in byte_402050
-> Must be exactly 20 characters long
-> Every character must matched when XORed
